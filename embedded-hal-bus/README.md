# `embedded-hal-bus`

Bus sharing utilities for [`embedded-hal`](https://crates.io/crates/embedded-hal), a Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) for embedded systems.

`embedded-hal` provides traits for SPI and I2C buses and devices. This crate provides hardware-independent adapters for sharing a single bus between multiple devices, compatible with the traits.

This project is developed and maintained by the [HAL team](https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg#the-hal-team).

## SPI

To support bus sharing, `embedded-hal` provides the `SpiBus` and `SpiDevice` traits. `SpiBus` represents an entire bus,
while `SpiDevice` represents a device on that bus. For further details on these traits, please consult the
[`embedded-hal` documentation](https://docs.rs/embedded-hal/latest/embedded_hal/spi/index.html).

`embedded-hal` trait implementations for microcontrollers should implement the `SpiBus` trait.
However, device drivers should use the `SpiDevice` traits, _not the `SpiBus` traits_ if at all possible
in order to allow for sharing of the bus they are connected to.

This crate provides mechanisms to connect a `SpiBus` and a `SpiDevice`.

## I2C

In the case of I2C, the same `I2c` `embedded-hal` trait represents either an entire bus, or a device on a bus. This crate
provides mechanisms to obtain multiple `I2c` instances out of a single `I2c` instance, sharing the bus.

## Optional Cargo features

- **`std`**: enable shared bus implementations using `std::sync::Mutex`.
- **`async`**: enable `embedded-hal-async` support.
- **`defmt-03`**: Derive `defmt::Format` from `defmt` 0.3 for enums and structs.

## Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)

This crate is guaranteed to compile on stable Rust 1.60 and up. It *might*
compile with older versions but that may change in any new patch release.

See [here](../docs/msrv.md) for details on how the MSRV may be upgraded.

Enabling the `async` Cargo features requires Rust 1.75 or higher.
