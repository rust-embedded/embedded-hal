/// `UnsafeCell`-based shared bus [`I2c`] implementation.
///
/// Sharing is implemented with a `UnsafeCell`. This means it has low overhead, similar to [`crate::i2c::RefCellDevice`] instances, but they are `Send`.
/// so it only allows sharing across multiple threads (interrupt priority levels). When attempting
/// to preempt usage of the bus, a `AtomicError::Busy` error is returned.
///
/// This primitive is particularly well-suited for applications that have external arbitration
/// rules, such as the RTIC framework.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Assuming there is a pressure sensor with address `0x42` on the same bus as a temperature sensor
/// with address `0x20`; [`AtomicDevice`] can be used to give access to both of these sensors
/// from a single `i2c` instance.
