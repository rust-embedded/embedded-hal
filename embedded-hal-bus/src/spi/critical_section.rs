/// Sharing is implemented with a `critical-section` [`Mutex`]. A critical section is taken for
/// the entire duration of a transaction. This allows sharing a single bus across multiple threads (interrupt priority levels).
/// The downside is critical sections typically require globally disabling interrupts, so `CriticalSectionDevice` will likely
/// negatively impact real-time properties, such as interrupt latency. If you can, prefer using
/// [`RefCellDevice`](super::RefCellDevice) instead, which does not require taking critical sections.
