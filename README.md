# `embedded-hal`

>  A Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) for embedded systems

This project is developed and maintained by the [HAL team](https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg#the-hal-team).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ðŸ“£ `embedded-hal` v1.0 is now released! Check out the [announcement blog post](https://blog.rust-embedded.org/embedded-hal-v1/), the [API documentation](https://docs.rs/embedded-hal) and the [migration guide](docs/migrating-from-0.2-to-1.0.md).

## Scope

`embedded-hal` serves as a foundation for building an ecosystem of platform-agnostic drivers.
(driver meaning library crates that let a target platform interface an external device like a digital
sensor or a wireless transceiver).

The advantage of this system is that by writing the driver as a generic library on top
of `embedded-hal` driver authors can support any number of target
platforms (e.g. Cortex-M microcontrollers, AVR microcontrollers, embedded Linux, etc.).

The advantage for application developers is that by adopting `embedded-hal` they can unlock all
these drivers for their platform.

For functionality that goes beyond what is provided by `embedded-hal`, users are encouraged
to use the target platform directly. Abstractions of common functionality can be proposed to be
included into `embedded-hal` as described [in this guide](docs/how-to-add-a-new-trait.md), though.

See more about the design goals in [this documentation section](https://docs.rs/embedded-hal/latest/embedded_hal/#design-goals).

## Crates

The main  `embedded-hal` project is not tied to a specific execution model like blocking or non-blocking.
