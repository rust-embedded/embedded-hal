//! Blocking I2C API.
//!
//! This API supports 7-bit and 10-bit addresses. Traits feature an [`AddressMode`]
//! marker type parameter. Two implementation of the [`AddressMode`] exist:
//! [`SevenBitAddress`] and [`TenBitAddress`].
//!
//! Through this marker types it is possible to implement each address mode for
//! the traits independently in `embedded-hal` implementations and device drivers
//! can depend only on the mode that they support.
//!
//! Additionally, the I2C 10-bit address mode has been developed to be fully
//! backwards compatible with the 7-bit address mode. This allows for a
//! software-emulated 10-bit addressing implementation if the address mode
//! is not supported by the hardware.
//!
//! Since 7-bit addressing is the mode of the majority of I2C devices,
//! [`SevenBitAddress`] has been set as default mode and thus can be omitted if desired.
//!
//! # Bus sharing
//!
//! I2C allows sharing a single bus between many I2C devices. The SDA and SCL lines are
//! wired in parallel to all devices. When starting a transfer an "address" is sent
//! so that the addressed device can respond and all the others can ignore the transfer.
//!
#![doc = include_str!("i2c-shared-bus.svg")]
//!
//! This bus sharing is common when having multiple I2C devices in the same board, since it uses fewer MCU
//! pins (`2` instead of `2*n`), and fewer MCU I2C peripherals (`1` instead of `n`).
//!
//! This API supports bus sharing natively. Types implementing [`I2c`] are allowed
//! to represent either exclusive or shared access to an I2C bus. HALs typically
//! provide exclusive access implementations. Drivers shouldn't care which
//! kind they receive, they just do transactions on it and let the
//! underlying implementation share or not.
//!
//! The [`embedded-hal-bus`](https://docs.rs/embedded-hal-bus) crate provides several
//! implementations for sharing I2C buses. You can use them to take an exclusive instance
//! you've received from a HAL and "split" it into multiple shared ones, to instantiate
//! several drivers on the same bus.
//!
//! # Flushing
//!
//! Implementations must flush the transfer, ensuring the bus has returned to an idle state before returning.
//! No pipelining is allowed. Users must be able to shut down the I2C peripheral immediately after a transfer
//! returns, without any risk of e.g. cutting short a stop condition.
//!
//! (Implementations must wait until the last ACK bit to report it as an error anyway. Therefore pipelining would only
//! yield very small time savings, not worth the complexity)
//!
//! # For driver authors
//!
//! Drivers can select the adequate address length with `I2c<SevenBitAddress>` or `I2c<TenBitAddress>` depending
//! on the target device. If it can use either, the driver can
//! be generic over the address kind as well, though this is rare.
//!
//! Drivers should take the `I2c` instance as an argument to `new()`, and store it in their
//! struct. They **should not** take `&mut I2c`, the trait has a blanket impl for all `&mut T`
//! so taking just `I2c` ensures the user can still pass a `&mut`, but is not forced to.
//!
//! Drivers **should not** try to enable bus sharing by taking `&mut I2c` at every method.
//! This is much less ergonomic than owning the `I2c`, which still allows the user to pass an
//! implementation that does sharing behind the scenes
//! (from [`embedded-hal-bus`](https://docs.rs/embedded-hal-bus), or others).
//!
//! ## Device driver compatible only with 7-bit addresses
//!
//! For demonstration purposes the address mode parameter has been omitted in this example.
//!
//! ```
//! use embedded_hal::i2c::{I2c, Error};
//!
//! const ADDR: u8 = 0x15;
//! # const TEMP_REGISTER: u8 = 0x1;
//! pub struct TemperatureSensorDriver<I2C> {
//!     i2c: I2C,
//! }
//!
//! impl<I2C: I2c> TemperatureSensorDriver<I2C> {
//!     pub fn new(i2c: I2C) -> Self {
//!         Self { i2c }
//!     }
//!
//!     pub fn read_temperature(&mut self) -> Result<u8, I2C::Error> {
//!         let mut temp = [0];
//!         self.i2c.write_read(ADDR, &[TEMP_REGISTER], &mut temp)?;
//!         Ok(temp[0])
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Device driver compatible only with 10-bit addresses
//!
//! ```
//! use embedded_hal::i2c::{Error, TenBitAddress, I2c};
//!
//! const ADDR: u16 = 0x158;
//! # const TEMP_REGISTER: u8 = 0x1;
//! pub struct TemperatureSensorDriver<I2C> {
//!     i2c: I2C,
//! }
//!
//! impl<I2C: I2c<TenBitAddress>> TemperatureSensorDriver<I2C> {
//!     pub fn new(i2c: I2C) -> Self {
//!         Self { i2c }
//!     }
//!
//!     pub fn read_temperature(&mut self) -> Result<u8, I2C::Error> {
//!         let mut temp = [0];
//!         self.i2c.write_read(ADDR, &[TEMP_REGISTER], &mut temp)?;
//!         Ok(temp[0])
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # For HAL authors
//!
//! HALs **should not** include bus sharing mechanisms. They should expose a single type representing
//! exclusive ownership over the bus, and let the user use [`embedded-hal-bus`](https://docs.rs/embedded-hal-bus)
//! if they want to share it. (One exception is if the underlying platform already
//! supports sharing, such as Linux or some RTOSs.)
//!
//! Here is an example of an embedded-hal implementation of the `I2C` trait
//! for both addressing modes. All trait methods have have default implementations in terms of `transaction`.
//! As such, that is the only method that requires implementation in the HAL.
//!
//! ```
//! use embedded_hal::i2c::{self, SevenBitAddress, TenBitAddress, I2c, Operation};
//!
//! /// I2C0 hardware peripheral which supports both 7-bit and 10-bit addressing.
//! pub struct I2c0;
//!
//! #[derive(Debug, Copy, Clone, Eq, PartialEq)]
//! pub enum Error {
//!     // ...
//! }
//!
//! impl i2c::Error for Error {
//!     fn kind(&self) -> i2c::ErrorKind {
//!         match *self {
//!             // ...
//!         }
//!     }
//! }

//! impl i2c::ErrorType for I2c0 {
//!     type Error = Error;
