## Unreleased

- Add adapters for the `embedded-storage` and `embedded-storage-async` traits.

## 0.6.1 - 2023-11-28

- Handle reading from `FromTokio` with empty buffer, ensuring `Ok(0)` is always returned.

- Return an error when a wrapped `std`/`futures`/`tokio` `write()` call returns
  `Ok(0)` to comply with `embedded_io::Write` requirements.
